LangChain is a framework designed to help developers build applications powered by language models. It provides tools and abstractions for working with large language models like GPT-4.

One of the core challenges in using LLMs is managing the context window — models can only take in a limited number of tokens. LangChain solves this by offering tools like document loaders, text splitters, and memory modules.

Text splitters are particularly useful when working with long documents. They break down text into chunks that fit within the LLM’s context window, optionally with overlapping content for continuity.

LangChain also supports retrieval-based question answering (RAG), where external documents are converted into embeddings, stored in a vector database, and queried based on similarity to a user's question.

With LangChain, developers can build chatbots, summarization tools, document Q&A apps, and more — all with minimal boilerplate.
